## [Getting Started]

- include gifs here
- Include relevant steps to run exercise files or start the app
- "Open the file located at exercise-repo-name/whatever in VS Code"

- Also, include instructions on how to open their terminal in 

- WHILE DOING THIS, LOOK OUT FOR ANY POTENTIAL WINDOWS FILE PATH ISSUES in exercises


## Exercise overview

Give quick overview about context of exercises and their intention


## Specific exercises listed in numbered order

Add disclaimer if exercises are stored inside of specific files as comments

Also, for a plain text reference, theres always the `EXERCISE-INSTRUCTIONS` files to pop open

To answer questions that don't require coding, please create a file in the repo named 
[exercise_number_answer].txt.

For example, if in one of the exercise repos question 13 just asked a question to explain a programming concept, store your answer inside of a new file named exercise_13_answer.txt.

### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Data Collections**:
    
    - Arrays: Creating, accessing, and manipulating arrays, using methods like `push`, `unshift`, `splice`, and `includes`.
    - Maps: Creating maps with the `Map` constructor, setting and getting values, and handling unique keys, including non-string keys.
    - Sets: Creating sets with the `Set` constructor, adding unique values, and using methods like `has` and `delete`.
2. **Looping Constructs**:
    
    - **While Loop**: Usage and potential pitfalls, like infinite loops.
    - **Do-While Loop**: How it differs from the while loop and when to use it.
    - **For Loop**: Structure and usage for iterating over arrays.
    - **For-Of Loop**: Simplifying iteration over array elements.
    - **For-In Loop**: Iterating over object properties.
    - **Loop Control**: Using `break` and `continue` for controlling loop flow, and understanding labeled statements for nested loops.
3. **Memory Management**:
    
    - Handling primitives and objects in memory.
    - Understanding reference types and how JavaScript manages collections.
